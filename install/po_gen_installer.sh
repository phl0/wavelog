# Wavelog PO-File Generator 
# COMPONENT: Installer
#
# HB9HIL <mail@hb9hil.org>, 2024

# This script is designed to help create consistent POT, PO, and MO files during Wavelog development.
# If you have added '__("english test strings")' within PHP files, you can run this script. It will automatically:
# 
#  - Scan all PHP files for gettext functions: __(), _ngettext(), _pgettext() 
#  - Recreate the POT file with the found strings
#  - Merge the POT file into the PO files of each language
#  - Compile MO files from the PO files
#
# It is important that this script is placed in the root directory of Wavelog.

#  Do NOT include the compiled MO files in a Pull Request.      #
#  This can cause unsolvable merge conflicts.                   #
